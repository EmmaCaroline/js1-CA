# js1-courseAssignment

This is my Javascript1 Course Assignment delivery.

For this website I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I used a previous website made purely with HTML and CSS as a starting point, so some of the files are still only HTML/CSS. 

Pages that I have implemented Javascript on:
index/html
women/index/html
men/index/html
sale/index/html
product/index/html
checkout/index/html
checkoutsuccess/index/html

All content that includes productdata are created with Javascript, also the forms on the checkout page.
